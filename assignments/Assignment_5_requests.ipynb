    "\n",
    "1. Expose an HTTP POST method at `/`, that accepts and decodes a JSON data body. That is the only method you have to expose.\n",
    "2. Get the request JSON data (using `request.get_json()`) and assume it's a dictionary. Now extract the value inside the dictionary under the key `password`. We will call this password for `client_password`.\n",
    "3. Choose a two-letter password (in ASCII) that is fixed for the server. Just choose two random letters/numbers. We will call this password `SERVER_PASSWORD`. If the decoded value for the `password` field is the *same* as your chosen password (`client_password == SERVER_PASSWORD`), return an HTTP code `200 OK`. Otherwise return the HTTP code `403 Forbidden` status code. You don't have to return a body.\n",
