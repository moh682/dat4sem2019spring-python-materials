Remember her to use the link provided when first registering your notebook with mybinder (not the url taken from your browsers adress field).

    "\n",
    "1. First create a file with your python module. This is where you should put your functions to be used in the notebook.\n",
    "2. Second create a function to read the csv file containing Copenhagen city population data and return a numpy array (numpy.ndarray). **hint:** use `np.genfromtxt(filename, delimiter=',', dtype=np.uint, skip_header=1)` as in the slides\n",
    "3. Third create a function that can extract the number of all the citizens from native english speaking countries and from non english speaking countries. How many are there of each? (**hint** remember that with python you can return multiple values from a function).\n",
    "4. Now create another function that can take 2 arguments: \n",
    "  - 1: the dataset in the form of a 2dimensional data array where y=data rows and x=[year, area, age nationality, amount].\n",
    "  - 2: the mask in the form: data[:,3] == 5120 to find swedish or data[:,0] == 1999 to filter on year\n",
    "  - the return value must be the filtered dataset.\n",
    "5. Create another function that can take 2 arguments:\n",
    "  - a dataset with same characteristics as above and\n",
    "  - a value for the x-axis (either year, area, age or nationality)\n",
    "  - return value should be the accumulated population for all x-values.\n",
    "  - **hint:** if year is chosen for x then y is all accumulated amounts from all areas, ages and nationalities.\n",
    "6. Create Illustration 1: In your notebook use the above function and create a 2d array of year as x and accumulated amount as y:\n",
    "  - create a line graph of the population change over time for all of Copenhagen\n",
    "7. Create illustration 2: In your notebook use your module to create a dataset where development of all German citizens can be shown over time\n",
    "8. Create illustration 3: Show a bar plot of all the 18-25 year old in the different areas of copenhagen and in the same plot show (in a different color) all 60-67 year old in the different areas.\n",
    "9. Create illustration 4: show a pie chart of age groups (0-10, 10-20, 20-30 ...) in Ã˜sterbro part of Copenhagen. create another similar piechart for Vesterbro."
